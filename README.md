## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project.

```
git clone git@github.com:inergy/taw-client.git
yarn
yarn start:full
```

After the vendor and localization have been built, you can simply run the following command to avoid the lengthly build time of yarn start:full (due to vendor files):

```
yarn start
```
